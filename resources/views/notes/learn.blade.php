                    <p>Euro (â‚¬) is the currency of the euro area and has been in circulation since 2002. The banknotes of the euro are issued by the national central banks of the Eurosystem or the European Central Bank. <br />
                    The euro notes contain many complex security features such as serial number, watermarks, invisible ink characteristics, holograms, optically variable inks and microprinting that document their authenticity. <br />
                    There are two series of euro banknotes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1st series issued from 2002;</li>
                        <li>2st series or Europa series issued from 2013.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each note has a unique serial number of 12 characters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1st series notes have a letter as first character (that specifies the country of issue) and 11 digits;</li>
                        <li>2st series notes have a letter as first character such as 1st series, but 10 digits because the second char is also letter in order to increment combinations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <p>Each country (i.e. first char) has a control code (for example the letter of Italy is 'S' and its control code is 7) and the sum of all digits and the ASCII of the second letter for Europa series until the result is less than 9 (i.e. the root), must be equals to control code in order to pass the checksum.
                    <br />
                    For example:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><it>SA2160296285</it> is the serial number;</li>
                        <li><it>'S'</it> specifies the country and, particularly, Italy with control code equals to <it>7</it>;</li>
                        <li>the ASCII of <it>A</it> is <it>65</it>;</li>
                        <li>the sum is: 6+5+2+1+6+0+2+9+6+2+8+5=52 -> 5+2=7;</li>
                        <li>the obtained root coincides with the control code.</li>

                <h3>What to do if the note is <span>not valid</span>?</h3>
                <p>A person who is doubtful about the legitimacy of a banknote should not try to spend it, because this would be a crime. He must have it examined by a teller of a commercial bank , Post Office or Bank of Italy branch.
                <br />
                If the teller thinks the note is a counterfeit, he or she must withdraw it from circulation and send it to the Bank of Italy's Head Office in Rome, where the suspected banknote National Analysis Centre (NAC) will establish whether or not it is a counterfeit.
                <br />
                When notes are withdrawn as suspected counterfeits, those who make the withdrawal draw up a report, a copy of which is given to the presenter of the note as a receipt. If the Bank of Italy finds the note to be legitimate, the presenter is reimbursed for the full amount with a BI cashier's cheque, otherwise the presenter receives nothing.
                <br />
                The Bank of Italy informs the entity that made the withdrawal (so-called "submitter") of the outcome of the examination.
                <br />
                Knowledge of the security features of banknotes is the most effective protection from counterfeit notes and the loss caused by accepting them.</p>
